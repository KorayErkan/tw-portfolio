# Technical Writing Portfolio

These are the documents I have created to demonstrate my technical writing skills.They are available as __pdf__, __html__, and __md__ files.

There are 8 document categories included here:

1. API Documentation
2. Installation Guide
3. Reference Charts
4. Release Notes
5. System Configuration Guide
6. Tutorial
7. User Assistance
8. User Manual

Each of these documents types is used for a specific purpose, and the samples here were edited with the specific purposes and structure of these categories in mind. However, the documents are only intended to be illustrative of my _general skills_, and are __not__ meant to be a thorough representation of real-life samples of this classification.

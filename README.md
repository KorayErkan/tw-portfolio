# Technical Writing Portfolio

These are the documents I have created to demonstrate my technical writing skills.

There are 8 document categories included here:

1. [API Documentation](./api-documentation)
2. [Installation Guide](./installation-guide)
3. [Reference Charts](./reference-charts/)
4. [Release Notes](./release-notes/)
5. [System Configuration Guide](./system-configuration-quide/)
6. [Tutorial](./tutorial/)
7. [User Assistance](./user-assistance/)
8. [User Manual](./user-manual/)

Each of these document types is used for a specific purpose, and the samples were edited with those purposes and the structure that entails in mind. However, the documents are only intended to be illustrative of my _general skills_, and are __not__ meant to be thorough representations of real-life samples.

All software entities, products, and services referred to in the text is intended to be imaginary, and any similarities with real life instances can only be coincidental. The mail addresses, phone numbers, etc. are also meant to be fake.

The files are available in Markdown, HTML, and PDF formats. The Markdown files allowed basic editing and layout, the HTML files allowed using stylesheet for Web presentation, and the PDF files allowed pagination and indexing. The text-based files (\*.md and \*.html) were developed with __Visual Studio Code__, and the PDFs were generated with __Scribus__.

Finally, I'm indebted to [Ugur Akinci](https://technicalcommunicationcenter.com) for informing me on the fundamentals of technical writing, as well as on the structure, components, and layout of the documents here, and I'd like to express my gratitude to him.

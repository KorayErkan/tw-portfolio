# Technical Writing Portfolio

These are the documents I have created to demonstrate my technical writing skills.They are available as __pdf__, __html__, and __md__ files.

There are 8 document categories included here:

1. API Documentation
2. Installation Guide
3. Reference Charts
4. Release Notes
5. System Configuration Guide
6. Tutorial
7. User Assistance
8. User Manual

Each of these documents is used for a specific purpose. The work is only intended to be illustrative of my general skills and is not meant to be an accurate representation of actual documents of their classification.

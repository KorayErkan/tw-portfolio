# Notes on Release Notes

This section is based on advice from [this web article](https://frill.co/blog/posts/how-to-write-release-notes), and [this web article](https://technicalcommunicationcenter.com/2021/01/03/how-to-write-a-software-release-notes-document/). I bear the sole responsibility of the documents, and these articles are mentioned only for courtesy.

## Reason and Purpose

Release Notes are published to address the following:

- Improving product utilization (by streamlining the features)
- Reducing *churn* (i.e. re-editing of developed code)
- Engaging new customers for conversion (by adding features likely to appeal to a wider audience)
- Reduce support tickets (by removing design errors and bugs in functionality)

## Document Requirements

The document should meet the following requirements:

- Have a release title and description
- Should cater to the technical knowledge of potential users
- Include associated user submissions

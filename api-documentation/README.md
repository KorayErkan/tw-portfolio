# API Documentation Samples

These files were created to demonstrate my skills in documenting APIs. There are 3 of them:

1. A command line tutorial explaining some __PowerShell__ functions for file management
2. The description of an imaginary __Web server__ that handles user requests
3. The description of the functionality of a __Stripe__ module

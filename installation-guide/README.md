# Installation Guide Sample

This sample document is based on advice that can be found in a [Technical Communication Center article](https://technicalcommunicationcenter.com/2009/09/09/how-to-write-a-software-installation-guide/). However, I bear the sole responsibility for the document, and that article is mentioned only for courtesy.

## Guide structure

The guide provides the following bits of information in its sections:

- Intro: what the software is, how it can be used, and what its benefits are. Also, dependencies and license terms that users need to agree with. Overview of system or product features. Also, "attended/unattended" installation can be mentioned.
- Prerequisites: any software that needs to be installed prior to this one. Again, dependencies and license terms
  - Minimal "quick start" configuration: this can be published as a "Quick Start Guide" as well. (May include drawings.)
  - Setup configurations: "typical" and "custom" configurations
- Installation: step-by-step instructions. (Includes screenshots.)
- Post-installation tasks: settings required for the software to function
  - Initial configuration
  - Maintanence, Errors and Troubleshooting

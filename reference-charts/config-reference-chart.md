# System Configuration Files

All the configurable parameters of the system are set using _system configuration files_ (__*.scf__). These are plain text files, and they use the following basic syntax&mdash;formulated in EBNF:

<pre id=ebnf-text>
component ::= "[" identifier ("." identifier)* "]"
property ::= identifier "=" (constant | "{" option (";" option)* "}")
option ::= (Default | User)

Default ::= "DEFAULT" ":" definition
User ::= "USER" ":" definition

comment ::= "--" text
</pre>

## Typical Uses

System components are identified by square brackets, and the settings of the component properties are specified between braces under that section.

The following table provides a few typical examples.

|Type|Examples|
|-|-|
|Component definition|`[system]`|
||`[database]`|
||`[database.tables]`|
|Property definition|`block_size = {SYSTEM: 4096; USER: 1024}`|
||`users.count = {USER: 150}`|
||`aligned = true`|
||`cloud_use = {DEFAULT: Local}`|
||`self_certificate = false`|

Each component or property has to be on a separate line, and line breaks are assumed to terminate the definition.

The following is an example of a __valid__ layout:

<pre id="config-text">
[database]
table_count = 50
record_size = {DEFAULT: 1024; USER: 4096}
</pre>

The following is an example of an __invalid__ layout: a section id and a property name are on the same line, and the settings of the ÄŸroperties are on the next lines.

<pre id="config-text">
[disks] block_size
= 2048
replicated =
true
</pre>

If a component specified does not exist or the value set for a property is not within a valid range or one of the predefined constants, the definition is ignored.

|Setting|Error|
|-|-|
|`[bicycles]`|The component doesn't exist|
|`frizzles = {DEFAULT: anything; USER: hunky-dory}`|The property doesn't exist, and the settings are not recognized|
|`disk_size = {ADMIN: sys_admin}`|The option does not exist|

## Configurable Settings

The following table enumerates the components that exist in the system and their properties along with the setting data types and allowable values. Each property can get a _default_ value which then can be overridden with a _user_ value, as stated in the above EBNF specification for options.

|Component|Property|Type|Acceptable Values|
|-|-|-|-|
|_system_|_id_|string|Any arbitrary identifier assigned by the user|
||_locale_|string|Valid locale settings are identical to those of all operating systems, e.g. _en-US_, _fr-FR_, _it-IT_, etc.|
||_cloud_use_|enumerated|Specifies whether the system will use cloud as storage. Can be either _Local_ or _Global_. If _Local_, cloud access and certificates have to be managed locally. If _Global_, the system will manage the certificates from a pool|
|_system.databases_|_count_|integer|The number of databases in the system|
||_backup_|boolean|Whether the system databases will be backed up|
||_auto_resize_|boolean|Whether the system databases will be resized automatically. If false, then the resize logic has to be specified with the next property|
||_resize_by_|integer|The resize value. Has to be a multiple of 1024|
|_database_|_id_|string|Any arbitrary identifier assigned by the user. Has to be the name of a specific database|
||_type_|enumerated|Type of the database. Has to be either _Flat_ or _Relational_. If _Flat_, no database keys are maintained by the system|
||_replicated_|boolean|Specifies whether the databases will be replicated on multiple sites|
||_user_count_|integer|The number of users that will be accessing the database|
|_database.tables_|_count_|integer|Number of tables in the database|
||_block_aligned_|boolean|Whether the table will be aligned on the disk for faster access. If _true_ is specificed the next value must also be set|
||_block_size_|integer|The block size to be used to align the records in the table. Must be a multiple of 1024|

# Creating A Score File

In order to create score files, you should have downloaded and installed the program. To create a score file, follow the steps below.

1. Launch MuseScore.
2. Create a new document by selecting _File_ > _New_ which opens the "_New Score Wizard_" you can see below:

   ![New Score wizard](pictures/new-score-wizard.png)

   Here you can enter a title for the document&mdash;here, our title is simply "Love Song"&mdash;after which you click _Next_.

3. In the next screen, double click on _Choose Instruments_.

4. A list of instruments will appear. Here, expand the _Keyboards_ branch and select _Piano_.   Once you've selected it, you can either double click the instrument's name or click the _Add to score_ button to add the instrument to the right pane.

   Then do the same for _Electric Bass_ and _Drums_. Once these are also added, the right-hand pane should look like this:

   Click _Next_ again.

5. One the next screen, you can pick a key signature:

   Here, we will pick the single-sharp (#) _E minor_ as our key and click _Next_.

6. We have arrived at the final screen of the wizard where we can pick a time signature, number of bars, and tempo.

   Pick the defaults and click _Finish_ to complete the wizard:

7. After the wizard closes, the score should look like this:

> __NOTE__
> If you are not happy with the page size, this can be changed by going to _Format_ > _Page Settings_ and picking the desired page size from the _Page Size_ drop down box.

Don't forget to click _File_ > _Save_ to save your newly created score. MuseScore will suggest a filename based on the title of the score, replacing spaces with underscores&mdash;in our case, that will be "Love_Song".

> __WARNING__
> By default, MuseScore files have the __.mscz__ extension. Although this is actually a __zip__ file, it should not be modified as MuseScore will not recognize any other extension.

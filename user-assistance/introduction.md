## What is MuseScore?

MuseScore is an open-source program to create music scores. In the following pages, we will illustrate how the program can be used to create music parts.

## Overview

Before the digital technology arrived, creating music scores was a time-consuming and expensive process that required very skilled craftsmen to design and print. Computer software now makes this much more intuitive and inexpensive. Ordinary musicians can use their computers to create music scores.

MuseScore is probably one of the best available on the market. And it's free.

Users can enter music parts by using a mouse, a computer keyboard, a digital music keyboard, etc. The entered information conforms to the MIDI standard, and is stored in files structured in an XML-based format. The parts can then be played back on the computer, on MIDI-compliant music instruments, or printed on paper-based media.

Below, you can see a sample generated output:

As of this writing [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/) is at version 4.1.1, but in the following pages we will use version 3.6.2.

# System Configuration Guide Samples

These types of documents are prepared for configuring the settings of a system to make sure it serves its intended design purposes after the first installation, during maintanence, or an upgrade.

## Reason and Purpose

A newly installed system needs to be installed to run smoothly. This may involve:

- Introducing networks, licenses and certificates
- Allocating computing resources such as servers and disks
- Creating and assigning users with specific access privileges, and making the network available to them
- Troubleshooting the errors that occur during use

The system may need to be upgraded at certain intervals (when there's a new release) and this may involve:

- Arranging for and running the scripts necessary to upgrade the system
- Updating any hardware, network, or user settings that may be required by the new version

Finally, the system may need to be decommissioned. This may involve:

- Backing up the resources and data the system has generated
- Uninstalling the system and releasing all the hardware and network resources it uses

## Document Requirements

The document shoud meet the following requirements:

- Have a title clearly identifying the purpose
- Have a brief summary of what the configuration activies may involve
- Cater to the technical needs of admins and elevated users
